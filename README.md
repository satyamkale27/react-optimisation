## Introduction

This section provides an overview of the project and its goals.

### Memoization

Memoization is an optimization technique to speed up applications by storing the results of expensive function calls.

### useMemo

`useMemo` is a React Hook that memoizes the result of a function call, preventing unnecessary recalculations on re-renders.

### useCallback

`useCallback` is a React Hook that returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. It is useful to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components.

## Examples

This section includes practical examples of each optimization technique.

## Conclusion

Summarizes the benefits and outcomes of applying these optimization techniques.
